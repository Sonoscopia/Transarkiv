# Transarkiv
Web-based audio archive mixer and recorder

# Preview Link

Although it might seem the same this version is different than the one in sonoscopia.pt/transarkiv (tha latter has a complete sound set, which is stored in sonoscopia.pt)

# Master branch
This branch has the same code as sonoscopia.pt
So...if you download it, it won't work on your computer, because it is meant to run on a server. You can alter the code to run on your computer or run a virtual server (ex: VS Code + LiveServer extension).
